	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in modern-day life, such as in smart homes, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the present security measures cannot fully protect the IoT due to its vulnerability to malicious assaults. Intrusion detection can protect IoT devices from the most harmful attacks as a security tool. Nevertheless, the time and detection efficiencies of conventional intrusion detection methods need to be more accurate. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a simple as well as intelligent security framework for protecting IoT from cyber-attacks. For this purpose, a combination of Decisive Red Fox (DRF) Optimization and Descriptive Back Propagated Radial Basis Function (DBRF) classification are developed in the proposed work. The novelty of this work is, a recently developed DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features. Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation parameters.},

	abstract = {Detection and classification of epileptic seizures from the EEG signals have gained significant attention in recent decades. Among other signals, EEG signals are extensively used by medical experts for diagnosing purposes. So, most of the existing research works developed automated mechanisms for designing an EEG-based epileptic seizure detection system. Machine learning techniques are highly used for reduced time consumption, high accuracy, and optimal performance. Still, it limits by the issues of high complexity in algorithm design, increased error value, and reduced detection efficacy. Thus, the proposed work intends to develop an automated epileptic seizure detection system with an improved performance rate. Here, the Finite Linear Haar wavelet-based Filtering (FLHF) technique is used to filter the input signals and the relevant set of features are extracted from the normalized output with the help of Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis. Then, the Grasshopper Bio-Inspired Swarm Optimization (GBSO) technique is employed to select the optimal features by computing the best fitness value and the Temporal Activation Expansive Neural Network (TAENN) mechanism is used for classifying the EEG signals to determine whether normal or seizure affected. Numerous intelligence algorithms, such as preprocessing, optimization, and classification, are used in the literature to identify epileptic seizures based on EEG signals. The primary issues facing the majority of optimization approaches are reduced convergence rates and higher computational complexity. Furthermore, the problems with machine learning approaches include a significant method complexity, intricate mathematical calculations, and a decreased training speed. Therefore, the goal of the proposed work is to put into practice efficient algorithms for the recognition and categorization of epileptic seizures based on EEG signals. The combined effect of the proposed FLHF, FD, GBSO, and TAENN models might dramatically improve disease detection accuracy while decreasing complexity of system along with time consumption as compared to the prior techniques. By using the proposed methodology, the overall average epileptic seizure detection performance is increased to 99.6\% with f-measure of 99\% and G-mean of 98.9\% values.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become a promising enabler for the next generation of wireless networks with the tremendous growth in electronics and communications. The application of UAV communications comprises messages relying on coverage extension for transmission networks after disasters, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and dispatching distress messages from the device positioned within the coverage hole to the emergency centre. But there are some problems in enhancing UAV clustering and scene classification using deep learning approaches for enhancing performance. This article presents a new White Shark Optimizer with Optimal Deep Learning based Effective Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Communication and Scene Classification (WSOODL-UAVCSC) technique. UAV clustering and scene categorization present many deep learning challenges in disaster management: scene understanding complexity, data variability and abundance, visual data feature extraction, nonlinear and high-dimensional data, adaptability and generalization, real-time decision making, UAV clustering optimization, sparse and incomplete data. the need to handle complex, high-dimensional data, adapt to changing environments, and make quick, correct decisions in critical situations drives deep learning in UAV clustering and scene categorization. The purpose of the WSOODL-UAVCSC technique is to cluster the UAVs for effective communication and scene classification. The WSO algorithm is utilized for the optimization of the UAV clustering process and enables to accomplish effective communication and interaction in the network. With dynamic adjustment of the clustering, the WSO algorithm improves the performance and robustness of the UAV system. For the scene classification process, the WSOODL-UAVCSC technique involves capsule network (CapsNet) feature extraction, marine predators algorithm (MPA) based hyperparameter tuning, and echo state network (ESN) classification. A wide-ranging simulation analysis was conducted to validate the enriched performance of the WSOODL-UAVCSC approach. Extensive result analysis pointed out the enhanced performance of the WSOODL-UAVCSC method over other existing techniques. The WSOODL-UAVCSC method achieved an accuracy of 99.12\%, precision of 97.45\%, recall of 98.90\%, and F1-score of 98.10\% when compared to other existing techniques.},

The application of IoT in the different sectors, including health, industry has also picked up the threads to augment over the past few years. The IoT and, by integrity, the IIoT, are found to be highly susceptible to different types of threats and attacks owing to the networks nature that in turn leads to even poor outcomes (i.e., increasing error rate). Hence, it is critical to design attack detection systems that can provide the security of IIoT networks. To overcome this research work of IIoT attack detection in large amount of evolutions is failed to determine the certain attacks resulting in a minimum detection performance, reinforcement learning-based attack detection method called sliding principal component and dynamic reward reinforcement learning (SPC–DRRL) for detecting various IIoT network attacks is introduced. In the first stage of this research methodology, preprocessing of raw TON\_IoT dataset is performed by employing min–max normalization scaling function to obtain normalized values with same scale. Next, with the processed sample data as output, to extract data from multi-sources (i.e., different service profiles from the dataset), a robust log likelihood sliding principal component-based feature extraction algorithm is applied with an arbitrary size sliding window to extract computationally-efficient features. Finally, dynamic reward reinforcement learning-based IIoT attack detection model is presented to control the error rate involved in the design. Here, with the design of dynamic reward function and introducing incident repository that not only generates the reward function in an arbitrary fashion but also stores the action results in the incident repository for the next training, therefore reducing the attack detection error rate. Moreover, an IIoT attack detection system based on SPC–DRRL is constructed. Finally, we verify the algorithm on the ToN\_IoT dataset of University of New South Wales Australia. The experimental results show that the IIoT attack detection time and overhead along with the error rate are reduced considerably with higher accuracy than that of traditional reinforcement learning methods.},

Wearable wireless medical sensor nodes allow continuous monitoring by amassing physiological data, which is very useful in healthcare applications. These text data are then sent to doctors via IoT devices so they can make an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible. However, the transmission of medical text data is extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique. The cost of computing has been reduced by 93\% due to the incorporation of aggregation technology. The communication cost is 400 bits which is a significant reduction when compared with its counterparts. The results of the security analysis show that the scheme is robust against forging, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The primary innovation is that the time required for signature verification can be reduced by using point addition and aggregation. In addition, it does away with the reliance on a centralized medical server in order to do verification. By taking a distributed approach, it is able to fully preserve user privacy, proving its superiority.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) technology in various applications used in data processing systems requires high security because more data must be saved in cloud monitoring systems. Even though numerous procedures are in place to increase the security and dependability of data in IoT applications, the majority of outside users can decode any transferred data at any time. Therefore, it is essential to include data blocks that, under any circumstance, other external users cannot understand. The major significance of proposed method is to incorporate an offloading technique for data processing that is carried out by using block chain technique where complete security is assured for each data. Since a problem methodology is designed with respect to clusters a load balancing technique is incorporated with data weights where parametric evaluations are made in real time to determine the consistency of each data that is monitored with IoT. The examined outcomes with five scenarios process that projected model on offloading analysis with block chain proves to be more secured thereby increasing the accuracy of data processing for each IoT applications to 89\%.},

	abstract = {The term flexible optical network (FON) for high-speed utility with Internet of Things (IoT) assistance refers to a kind of network infrastructure that combines the advantages of FON with IoT technology to make it possible to provide high-speed and effective utility services. IoT applications are a feature of the modern era. In this study, we offered the notion that an optical network is employed to create high-speed IoT assistance. There are many other access network types accessible, but FON is used in this case which has greater efficiency and lower cost than Active Optical Network owing to the easy setup of components, making it highly popular in today’s society. Here, FON technologies are explained, and several ways of showing how they relate to the IoT are provided. Use case and requirements of IoT as well as viable solutions for high-speed utility and FON with Performance analysis of FON covers various aspects, such as average broadband speed (2022: 88 Mbps), IoT data access rate (LTE: 20 kb/s, WDM: 39 kb/s, VDSL2: 32 kb/s), FON factors (2022: Optical network equipment: 51, Optical line terminal: 64, Security: 76, Network management: 89), FON types with transmission speed (GFON: 32 Mbps, XGFON: 52 Mbps, TWDM-FON: 67 Mbps, SMA: 73 Mbps, HSMA: 92 Mbps), and energy consumption (Reach: 20, Data rate: 18, Power Rate: 10, Cost: 30) are used to increase the high efficiency of FON. If an IoT over FON architecture network of different nodes is employed, power consumption may be reduced while still using all available capabilities. We also go through the latest developments in optical devices, optical switching, and Optical Network (ON) technologies related to high-speed networks. Finally, we wrap up the study by discussing how these technologies have improved network intelligence and allowed deterministic content delivery across FON’s high-speed capabilities.},

The majority of the currently available methods are implemented as comprehensive monitoring systems, with significant success in monitored applications like bridges, railways, etc. So, the predicted model is developed exclusively for specific monitoring settings, as opposed to the broad conditions that are used by the current approaches. Also, in the design model, the first steps are taken by limiting the procedure to specific heights, and the input thrust that is provided for take up operation is kept to a minimum. Due to the improved altitudes, the velocity and acceleration units have been cranked up on purpose, making it possible to sidestep intact objects. In addition, Advanced Image Mapping Localization (AIML) is used to carry out the implementation process, which identifies stable sites at the correct rotation angle. Besides, Cyphal protocol integration improves the security of the data-gathering process by transmitting information gathered from sensing devices. The suggested system is put to the test across five different case studies, where the designed Unmanned aerial vehicle can able to detect 25 obstacles in the narrow paths in considered routs but existing approach can able to identify only 14 obstacle in the same routes.},

	abstract = {Effective management and control of large-scale networks can be challenging in the absence of appropriate resource allocation. This paper presents a framework for highlighting the significance of resource allocation in mobile, wireless, and ad hoc networks. The model has been designed to incorporate a clustering protocol and a schedule-based resource allocation algorithm, resulting in the establishment of a multi-objective framework. The proposed framework places a significant emphasis on the allocation of energy and distance, with a focus on minimizing these objectives. Each node is separated into several clusters where individual energy is allocated and the cluster head in each cluster allows the nodes to communication with shortest distance. For the transmitted information the speed of transmission is maximized thus more amount of time period is saved where stability factor is maximized. To test the allocated resources in the network the proposed method compares and evaluates the parametric outcomes with existing method based on five scenarios. In the comparative analysis it is observed that proposed method can able to maximize the life time and quality of service for all networks with optimized range of 84\%.},

The quantification of resources is facilitated through the utilization of parameters, namely energy, capacity, and power, which are equipped with proximity constraints. These constraints are then integrated with activation functions in both multilayer perceptron and long short term memory models. Furthermore, the system model has been developed using vision-based computing, which involves managing data queues in terms of waiting periods to minimize congestion for data transmission with limited resources. The major significance of the proposed method is to utilize allocated spectrums for future generation networks by allocating necessary resources and therefore high usage of resources by all users can be avoided. In addition the advantage of the proposed method is secure the networks that operate beyond 5G where more number of users will try to share the allocated resources that needs to be provided with high security conditions.},

The RCOA, intriguingly inspired by the time response of a resistance–capacitance circuit to a sudden voltage fluctuation, has been earmarked for solving complex numerical and engineering design optimization problems. Uniquely, the RCOA operates without any control/tunable parameters. In the first phase of this study, we evaluated the RCOA's credibility and functionality by deploying it on a set of 23 benchmark test functions. This was followed by thoroughly examining its application in eight distinct constrained engineering design optimization scenarios. This methodical approach was undertaken to dissect and understand the algorithm's exploration and exploitation phases, leveraging standard benchmark functions as the yardstick. The principal findings underline the significant effectiveness of the RCOA, especially when contrasted against various state-of-the-art algorithms in the field. Beyond its apparent superiority, the RCOA was put through rigorous statistical non-parametric testing, further endorsing its reliability as an innovative tool for handling complex engineering design problems. The conclusion of this research underscores the RCOA's strong performance in terms of reliability and precision, particularly in tackling constrained engineering design optimization challenges. This statement, derived from the systematic study, strengthens RCOA's position as a potentially transformative tool in the mathematical optimization landscape. It also paves the way for further exploration and adaptation of physics-inspired algorithms in the broader realm of optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the privacy and trustworthiness of smart city—Internet of Things (IoT) networks have recently remained the central problem. Cyborg intelligence is one of the most popular and advanced technologies suitable for securing smart city networks against cyber threats. Various machine learning and deep learning-based cyborg intelligence mechanisms have been developed to protect smart city networks by ensuring property, security, and privacy. However, it limits the critical problems of high time complexity, computational cost, difficulty to understand, and reduced level of security. Therefore, the proposed work intends to implement a group of novel methodologies for developing an effective Cyborg intelligence security model to secure smart city systems. Here, the Quantized Identical Data Imputation (QIDI) mechanism is implemented at first for data preprocessing and normalization. Then, the Conjugate Self-Organizing Migration (CSOM) optimization algorithm is deployed to select the most relevant features to train the classifier, which also supports increased detection accuracy. Moreover, the Reconciliate Multi-Agent Markov Learning (RMML) based classification algorithm is used to predict the intrusion with its appropriate classes. The original contribution of this work is to develop a novel Cyborg intelligence framework for protecting smart city networks from modern cyber-threats. In this system, a combination of unique and intelligent mechanisms are implemented to ensure the security of smart city networks. It includes QIDI for data filtering, CSOM for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction, and RMML for categorizing the type of intrusion. By using these methodologies, the overall attack detection performance and efficiency have been greatly increased in the proposed cyborg model. Here, the main reason of using CSOM methodology is to increase the learning speed and prediction performance of the classifier while detecting intrusions from the smart city networks. Moreover, the CSOM provides the optimized set of features for improving the training and testing operations of classifier with high accuracy and efficiency. Among other methodologies, the CSOM has the unique characteristics of increased searching efficiency, high convergence, and fast processing speed. During the evaluation, the different types of cyber-threat datasets are considered for testing and validation, and the results are compared with the recent state-of-the-art model approaches.},

Recently, deep learning models have become popular as a means of handling massive amounts of data but their potential to categorize the aberrant human activity remains unexplored.

After analyzing the video, our suggested architecture can reliably assign an abnormal human behavior to its designated category.

Transmission of multimedia data to all end users through a variety of visualization methods is the foundation of future computer systems. Yet, highly limited system resources prevent the updating of the methods used to manage multimedia data. Hence, a high-end visualization technique where uncertainties are eliminated is required for the visualization process with a multimedia system. As a result, the suggested system incorporates a clustering technique utilizing an analytical framework to ensure a high degree of transmission for all multimedia data. The technical contribution of the proposed method depend on multimedia visualization process that takes place with high security features by including necessary parametric relationships such as occurrence of jitter, data density points, time period, multimedia storage, data smoothness and distance. For the established parametric relationship the validation methodology is integrated with hierarchical clustering algorithm thereby transmitting every clustered data with high security feature thereby the examined outcomes under five scenarios proves that data security which is represented by simulation outcomes is improved to 88\% as compared to existing approach.},

Typically, the SCADA is more prone to the security issues due to their environmental problems and vulnerabilities. Therefore, the proposed work intends to design a new detection approach by integrating the optimization and classification models for smart grid SCADA security. In this framework, the min-max normalization is performed at first for noise removal and attributes arrangement. Here, the correlation estimation mechanism is mainly deployed to reduce the dimensionality of features by choosing the relevant features used for attack prediction. Moreover, the optimal features are selected by using the optimal solution provided by the Holistic Harris Hawks Optimization (H3O). Finally, the Perceptron Stochastic Neural Network (PSNN) is utilized to categorize the normal and attacking data flow in the network with minimal processing time and complexity. By using the combination of proposed H3O-PSNN technique, the detection accuracy is improved up to 99\% for all datasets used in this study, and also other measures such as precision to 99.2\%, recall to 99\%, f1-score to 99.2\% increased, when compared to the standard techniques.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has arisen as a new computing platform that pushes computational power to the edge of the Internet and close to end users. Additionally, a rising number of scholars are performing various sorts of research within the framework of edge devices. The security risks of resource consumers are elevated since edge computing frequently lacks a centralized security mechanism, in contrast to cloud computing. Therefore, in this research, we focus on creating a reliable trust evaluation mechanism to overcome security concerns for enabling MEC successfully. As a result of their limited capacity for data storage and processing, these devices help pave the way for the emerging edge computing paradigm. Reputation data is processed locally on edge devices, with just the necessary data being transferred to the Cloud, which improves reliability and reduces the load on the network as a whole. There is a lack of trust amongst devices in the IoT because of the inherent security threats and assaults they face. To mitigate this threat, we offer a lightweight trust management model to oversee a device’s trustworthiness and the trustworthiness of its service levels, as well as the quality of service those levels provide (QoS). In order to determine an aggregate level of trust, the model uses QoS characteristics as weights to evaluate the trust of devices. The enhanced outcomes of QoS-parameterized trust management models suggest that they may be useful for detecting malicious edge nodes in edge computing networks, which would have practical applications in industry.},

This research intends to develop a new model for UAV transmissions across distinct network nodes, which is necessary since an automatic monitoring system is required to enhance the current D2D application infrastructure. The real time significance of proposed UAV for D2D communications can be observed during data transmission state where individual data will have huge impact on maximizing the D2D security. Additionally, through the use of simulation, an exploratory persistence tool is offered for CPS networks with fully characterized energy issues. This UAV CPS paradigm is based on mobility nodes, which host concurrent systems and control algorithms. In sixth-generation networks, when there are no barriers and the collision rate is low and the connectivity is fast, the method is also feasible. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can now cover great distances, even while encountering hazardous obstacles. When compared to the preexisting models, the simulated values for autonomous, collision, and parametric reliability are much better by an average of 87\%. The proposed model, however, is shown to be highly independent and exhibits stable perceptual behaviour. The proposed UAV approach is optimal for real-time applications due to its potential for more secure operation via a variety of different communication modules.},

The diagnostic procedure's complexity causes radiologists to disagree with the decision. Early diagnosis is the only feasible strategy for mitigating the disease's impact on the patent. Computer-aided diagnostics improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Recent studies established that Quaternion neural networks classify and predict better than real-valued neural networks, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional or multi-channel input. The attention mechanism has been derived from the human brain's visual and cognitive ability in which it focuses on some portion of the image and ignores the rest portion of the image. The attention mechanism maximizes the usage of the image's relevant aspects, hence boosting classification accuracy. In the current work, we propose a QCSA network (Quaternion Channel-Spatial Attention Network) by combining the spatial and channel attention mechanism with Quaternion residual network to classify chest X-Ray images for Pneumonia detection. We used a Kaggle X-ray dataset. The suggested architecture achieved 94.53\% accuracy and 0.89 AUC. We have also shown that performance improves by integrating the attention mechanism in QCNN. Our results indicate that our approach to detecting pneumonia is promising.},

This article presents an ontology-based disaster management framework based on the NDMA’s responsibility matrix. This ontological base framework is named as Disaster Management Ontology (DMO). It aids in task distribution among necessary authorities at various stages of a disaster, as well as a knowledge-driven decision support system for financial assistance to victims. In the proposed DMO, ontology has been used to integrate knowledge as well as a working platform for reasoners, and the Decision Support System (DSS) ruleset is written in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which is based on the First Order Logic (FOL) concept. In addition, OntoGraph, a class view of taxonomy, is used to make taxonomy more interactive for users.},

Because of physical limits, the termination of Moore’s law and Dennard’s scaling has forced the computer design community to investigate new approaches to meet the requirements for computing resources. Approximate computing has emerged as a promising method for reducing energy consumption while trading a controllable quality loss. This paper asserts that an approximated cache coherence protocol preserves overall energy for computation. We can approximate the cache coherence protocol by adding approximated cache lines to a certain level without hindering the output. This paper introduces an enhanced approximated version of the MSI (Modified Shared Invalid) cache coherence protocol MSI-A (Modified Shared Invalid-Approx). We have verified MSI-A and MSI by employing LTL specifications in the NuSMV model checker. To illustrate the benefits of MSI-A, we have added DTMC (Discrete-Time Markov Chain) with PCTL (Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic). Although the PCTL proves the theory of approximation, we have also simulated the MSI-A in the TEJAS hardware simulator on PARSEC 3.0 to investigate the energy gains and cycle gains of MSI-A in varied applications. The cache lines considered to be approx are between 10 and 30 percent. Each application benefited from approximation according to its nature, and VIPS has indicated a total energy gain of 30.18 percent.},

	abstract = {Many researchers have been interested in healthcare cybersecurity for a long time since it can improve the security of patient and health record data. As a result, a lot of research is done in the field of cybersecurity that focuses on the safe exchange of health data between patients and the medical setting. It still has issues with high computational complexity, increased time consumption, and cost complexity, all of which have an impact on the effectiveness and performance of the complete security system. Hence this work proposes a technique called Consultative Transaction Key Generation and Management (CTKGM) to enable secure data sharing in healthcare systems. It generates a unique key pair based on random values with multiplicative operations and time stamps. The patient data is then safely stored in discrete blocks of hash values using the blockchain methodology. The Quantum Trust Reconciliation Agreement Model (QTRAM), which calculates the trust score based on the feedback data, ensures reliable and secure data transfer. By allowing safe communication between patients and the healthcare system based on feedback analysis and trust value, the proposed framework makes a novel contribution to the field. Additionally, during communication, the Tuna Swarm Optimization (TSO) method is employed to validate nonce verification messages. Nonce message verification is a part of QTRAM that helps verify the users during transmission. The effectiveness of the suggested scheme has been demonstrated by comparing the obtained findings with other current state-of-the-art models after a variety of evaluation metrics have been analyzed to test the performance of this security model.},

	abstract = {Background: In many medically developed applications, the process of early diagnosis in
cases of pulmonary disease does not exist. Many people experience immediate suffering due to the lack
of early diagnosis, even after becoming aware of breathing difficulties in daily life. Because of this,
identifying such hazardous diseases is crucial, and the suggested solution combines computer vision and
communication processing techniques. As computing technology advances, a more sophisticated mechanism
is required for decision-making.

Objective: The major objective of the proposed method is to use image processing to demonstrate computer
vision-based experimentation for identifying lung illness. In order to characterize all the uncertainties
that are present in nodule segments, an improved support vector machine is also integrated into the
decision-making process.

Methods: As a result, the suggested method incorporates an Improved Support Vector Machine (ISVM)
with a clear correlation between various margins. Additionally, an image processing technique is introduced
where all impacted sites are marked at high intensity to detect the presence of pulmonary syndrome.
Contrary to other methods, the suggested method divides the image processing methodology into
groups, making the loop generation process much simpler.

Results: Five situations are taken into account to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested technique,
and test results are compared with those from existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed technique with ISVM produces 83 percent of successful results.},

This will help to trace the mobile phones using the calls from the threatening person, and the data is gathered from the database while tracing. From this concern, the data analysis process is based on decision-making. They adapted the data encountered by the detailed data in the statistical modeling of the system to produce exploratory data analysis for satisfying the data from the database.

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to deliver innovative business models across multiple domains by providing ubiquitous connectivity, intelligent data, predictive analytics, and decision-making systems for improved market performance. However, traditional IIoT architectures are highly susceptible to many security vulnerabilities and network intrusions, which bring challenges such as lack of privacy, integrity, trust, and centralization. This research aims to implement an Artificial Intelligence-based Lightweight Blockchain Security Model (AILBSM) to ensure privacy and security of IIoT systems. This novel model is meant to address issues that can occur with security and privacy when dealing with Cloud-based IIoT systems that handle data in the Cloud or on the Edge of Networks (on-device). The novel contribution of this paper is that it combines the advantages of both lightweight blockchain and Convivial Optimized Sprinter Neural Network (COSNN) based AI mechanisms with simplified and improved security operations. Here, the significant impact of attacks is reduced by transforming features into encoded data using an Authentic Intrinsic Analysis (AIA) model. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate this system using various attack datasets. In addition, the results of privacy protection and AI mechanisms are evaluated separately and compared using various indicators. By using the proposed AILBSM framework, the execution time is minimized to 0.6 seconds, the overall classification accuracy is improved to 99.8\%, and detection performance is increased to 99.7\%. Due to the inclusion of auto-encoder based transformation and blockchain authentication, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed model is highly improved, when compared to other techniques.},

But the development and success of such process is usually carried out using specification in score type maneuvers. However the effect of naval operation can only be examined in real time by using a well-defined bi-conditional statement system that integrates the communication device for choosing intelligent route. Therefore a fuzzy logic system is implemented for observing the effect of underwater applications using a defined system model. But unlike in existing models the sonar type model with data handling technique is not used but a secured data transfer approach is created using the constraint statements. Further to prove the effectiveness of the developed system with fuzzy logic five scenarios are described with performance analysis where the outcomes proves that projected method provides high effectiveness for about 67\% as compared to existing method.},

An external storage space is required for practical purposes whenever a data storage platform is created. However, in the IoT, certain cutting-edge storage methods have been developed that compromise the security and privacy of data transfer processes. As a result, the suggested solution creates a standard mode of security operations for storing the data with little noise. One of the most distinctive findings in the suggested methodology is the incorporation of machine learning algorithms in the formulation of analytical representations. The aforementioned integration method ensures high-level quantitative measurements of data security and privacy. Due to the transmission of large amounts of data, users are now able to assess the reliability of data transfer channels and the duration of queuing times, where each user can separate the specific data that has to be transferred. The created system is put to the test in real time using the proper metrics, and it is found that machine learning techniques improve security more effectively. Additionally, for 98 percent of the scenarios defined, the accuracy for data security and privacy is maximized, and the predicted model outperforms the current method in all of them.},

Due to high-weight functionalities, it is observed that if the drone drops at a particular point, the entire design is fragmented. Also, well-defined functionalities of drones for a specific application can only be designed if radial functionalities are defined at proper angles. Therefore, this article addresses the issues present in the existing method using the CRA algorithm, where radial functions, represented in terms of input and hidden weighting functions, are explored utterly. Additionally, a novel analytical procedure that establishes the coverage area for the data transfer approach has been incorporated into the drones’ architecture. Additionally, employing motion signatures and a special identification system, the developed drone system can function along various paths. To evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested system, three scenarios are organized as a basic functionality model. With the right scattering ratio, the comparison inscriptions show that the proposed approach can achieve an 82\% success rate.},

	abstract = {Many people in society are facing problems related to health care, and diseases in the body are unable to be identified even with the presence of sensing technologies. The major reason for such failures in the identification process is that no virtual technologies are identified in the market. Most healthcare solicitations aim to design a particular application that provides information only about sensing values and fails to recall the virtual representation of that represented values. Therefore, this article provides an integration platform that connects the sensing devices with virtual reality/audio reality (VR/AR) techniques, which are applied in real time for detecting the presence of infections inside the body. In addition, one type of swarm intelligent algorithm is implemented in the recognition procedure with a modified fitness function and it is termed fruit fly optimization (FFO). The process of FFO provides much low layer perception, thus enhancing the output for smooth operation. To examine the real-time conditions, the projected AR/VR procedure is applied with biomedical sensors where three different case studies are separated. From the comparative numerical results, it is pragmatic that the proposed method provides better numerical results with 65\% full-scale representations and less than 0.5 dB of distortion at 0.3\% tuning force.},

	abstract = {On-demand computing ability and efficient service delivery are the major benefits of cloud systems. The limitation in resource availability in single data centers causes the extraction of additional resources from the cloud providers group. The federation scheme dynamically increases resource availability in response to service requests. The dynamic increase in resource count leads to excessive energy consumption, maximum cost, and carbon footprints emission. Hence, the reduction of resources is the major requirement to construct the optimized cloud source models for profit maximization without considering energy mix and CO2. This paper proposes the novel migration method to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption. The initial stage in the proposed work is the categorization of data centers based on the MIPS and cost prior to job allocation offers scalable and efficient services and resources to the cloud user. Then, the job with the maximum size is allotted to the VM only if its capacity is less than the cumulative capacity of data centers. A novel migration based on overutilized and underutilized levels provides the services to the user even if the particular VM fails. The proposed work offers efficient maintenance of resource availability and maximizes the profit of the cloud providers associated with the federated cloud environment. The comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm with the existing methods regarding the response time, accuracy, profit, carbon emission, and energy consumption assures the effectiveness in a confederated cloud environment.},

	abstract = {It is significantly more challenging to extend the visibility factor to a higher depth during the development phase of a communication system for subterranean places. Even if there are numerous optical fiber systems that provide the right energy sources for intended panels, the visibility parameter is not optimized past a certain point. Therefore, the suggested method looks at the properties of a fiber optic communication system that is integrated with a certain energy source while having external panels. A regulating state is established in addition to characteristic analysis by minimizing the reflection index, and the integration of the general adversarial network (GAN) optimizes both central and layer formations in exterior panels. Thus, the suggested technique uses the external noise factor to provide relevant data to the control center via fiber optic shackles. As a result, the normalized error is smaller, boosting the suggested method's effectiveness in all subsurface areas. The created mathematical model is divided into five different situations, and the results are simulated using MATLAB to test the effectiveness of the anticipated strategy. Additionally, comparisons are done for each of the five scenarios, and it is found that the proposed fiber-optic method for energy sources is far more effective than current methodologies.},
