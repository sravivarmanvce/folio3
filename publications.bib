	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in modern-day life, such as in smart homes, intelligent transportation, etc. However, the present security measures cannot fully protect the IoT due to its vulnerability to malicious assaults. Intrusion detection can protect IoT devices from the most harmful attacks as a security tool. Nevertheless, the time and detection efficiencies of conventional intrusion detection methods need to be more accurate. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a simple as well as intelligent security framework for protecting IoT from cyber-attacks. For this purpose, a combination of Decisive Red Fox (DRF) Optimization and Descriptive Back Propagated Radial Basis Function (DBRF) classification are developed in the proposed work. The novelty of this work is, a recently developed DRF optimization methodology incorporated with the machine learning algorithm is utilized for maximizing the security level of IoT systems. First, the data preprocessing and normalization operations are performed to generate the balanced IoT dataset for improving the detection accuracy of classification. Then, the DRF optimization algorithm is applied to optimally tune the features required for accurate intrusion detection and classification. It also supports increasing the training speed and reducing the error rate of the classifier. Moreover, the DBRF classification model is deployed to categorize the normal and attacking data flows using optimized features. Here, the proposed DRF-DBRF security model's performance is validated and tested using five different and popular IoT benchmarking datasets. Finally, the results are compared with the previous anomaly detection approaches by using various evaluation parameters.},

	abstract = {Detection and classification of epileptic seizures from the EEG signals have gained significant attention in recent decades. Among other signals, EEG signals are extensively used by medical experts for diagnosing purposes. So, most of the existing research works developed automated mechanisms for designing an EEG-based epileptic seizure detection system. Machine learning techniques are highly used for reduced time consumption, high accuracy, and optimal performance. Still, it limits by the issues of high complexity in algorithm design, increased error value, and reduced detection efficacy. Thus, the proposed work intends to develop an automated epileptic seizure detection system with an improved performance rate. Here, the Finite Linear Haar wavelet-based Filtering (FLHF) technique is used to filter the input signals and the relevant set of features are extracted from the normalized output with the help of Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis. Then, the Grasshopper Bio-Inspired Swarm Optimization (GBSO) technique is employed to select the optimal features by computing the best fitness value and the Temporal Activation Expansive Neural Network (TAENN) mechanism is used for classifying the EEG signals to determine whether normal or seizure affected. Numerous intelligence algorithms, such as preprocessing, optimization, and classification, are used in the literature to identify epileptic seizures based on EEG signals. The primary issues facing the majority of optimization approaches are reduced convergence rates and higher computational complexity. Furthermore, the problems with machine learning approaches include a significant method complexity, intricate mathematical calculations, and a decreased training speed. Therefore, the goal of the proposed work is to put into practice efficient algorithms for the recognition and categorization of epileptic seizures based on EEG signals. The combined effect of the proposed FLHF, FD, GBSO, and TAENN models might dramatically improve disease detection accuracy while decreasing complexity of system along with time consumption as compared to the prior techniques. By using the proposed methodology, the overall average epileptic seizure detection performance is increased to 99.6\% with f-measure of 99\% and G-mean of 98.9\% values.},
