The put forth tack is instilled with the electroencephalogram (EEG) database acquired in real-time from CARE Hospital, Nagpur. Additional data is also acquired from a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the working model, signals from the database are wed out into different frequency sub-bands using DWT. Initially, updated statistical features are obtained from different frequency sub-bands. This type of representation defines the wavelet co-efficient which is introduced for reducing the measurement of data. Then, the projected method is realized using SVM for segregating both port and veracious hand movement. After segregation of EEG signals, results are achieved with an accuracy of 92\% for BCI competition paradigm III and 97.89\% for B-alert machine.},

The incorporation of high-dimensional characteristics in training datasets in the learning phase of ML models influences contemporary approaches to emotion prediction with significant false alerting. The curse of the excessive dimensionality of the training corpus is addressed in the majority of contemporary models. Modern models, on the other hand, place a greater emphasis on merging many classifiers, which can only increase emotion recognition accuracy even when the training corpus contains high-dimensional data points. “Ensemble Learning by High-Dimensional Acoustic Features (EL-HDAF)” is an innovative ensemble model that leverages the diversity assessment of feature values spanned over diversified classes to recommend the best features. Furthermore, the proposed technique employs a one-of-a-kind clustering process to limit the impact of high-dimensional feature values. The experimental inquiry evaluates and compares emotion forecasting using spoken audio data to current methods that use machine learning for emotion recognition. Fourfold cross-validation is used for performance analysis with the standard data corpus.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has already demonstrated its use. RFID is used in many productions for different applications, for example, apparatus chasing, personal and vehicle access panels, logistics, baggage, and safety items in departmental stores. The main benefits of RFID are optimizing resources, quality customer service, improved accuracy, and efficient business and healthcare procedures. In addition, RFID can help to recognize appropriate information and help advance the probability of objects for certain functions. Nevertheless, RFID components need to be studied for use in healthcare. Antennas, tags, and readers are the main components of RFID. The study of these elements provides an understanding of the usage and integration of these components in healthcare environments. The security of the patient is now a global alarm for public health, particularly among older people who need integrated and technologically integrated physiological health monitoring systems to monitor medical needs and manage them. This paper proposes using Internet of Things (IoT) and RFID tags as an effective healthcare monitoring system. In this method, we utilize RFID dual-band protocols that are useful for identifying individual persons and are used to monitor body information using high frequency. The patient’s physiological data are monitored and collected by sensors to recognize the patient, using an RFID tag. The IoT-based RFID healthcare provides the elderly and people with physiological information. The aim is also to secure patient health records using the signing algorithm based on the hyperelliptic curve (HEC) and to provide the physician with access to health information for patients. Furthermore, the confidentiality of the medical records for patients of variable length is provided. The evaluation reveals the algorithm proposed for optimum health care with different genus curves.},

Skin disorders provide a significant public health risk across the globe. They become dangerous when they enter the invasive phase. Dermatological illnesses are a significant concern for the medical community. Because of increased pollution and poor diet, the number of individuals with skin disorders is on the rise at an alarming rate. People often overlook the early signs of skin illness. The current approach for diagnosing and treating skin conditions relies on a biopsy process examined and administered by physicians. Human assessment can be avoided with a hybrid technique, thus providing hopeful findings on time. Approaches to a thorough investigation indicate that deep learning methods might be used to construct frameworks capable of identifying diverse skin conditions. Skin and non-skin tissue must be distinguished to detect skin diseases. This research developed a skin disease classification system using MobileNetV2 and LSTM. For this system, accuracy in skin disease forecasting is the primary aim while ensuring excellent efficiency in storing complete state information for exact forecasts.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing, one of the most valuable industries in the world, is boundlessly automatable yet still quite stuck in traditionally manual and slow processes. Industry 4.0 is racing to define a new era of digital manufacturing through Internet of Things- (IoT-) connected machines and factory systems, fully comprehensive data gathering, and seamless implementation of data-driven decision-making and action taking. Both academia and industry understand the tremendous value in modernizing manufacturing and are pioneering bleeding-edge strides every day to optimize one of the largest industries in the world. IoT production, functional testing, and fault detection equipment are already being used in today’s maturing smart factory paradigm to superintend intelligent manufacturing equipment and perform automated defect detection in order to enhance production quality and efficiency. This paper presents a powerful and precise computer vision model for automated classification of defect product from standard product. Human operators and inspectors without digital aid must spend inordinate amounts of time poring over visual data, especially in high volume production environments. Our model works quickly and accurately in sparing defective product from entering doomed operations that would otherwise incur waste in the form of wasted worker-hours, tardy disposition, and field failure. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Visual Geometry Group with 16 layers (VGG16) architecture and train it on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) dataset with 3175 RBG images. The resultant trained model, assisted by finely tuned optimizers and learning rates, classifies defective product with 97.01\% validating accuracy.},

For solving the issues, conventional methods are not implemented, whereas a new underwater vehicle is introduced which acts as a sensing device and monitors the ambient noise in the system. However, the fundamentals of creating underwater vehicles have been considered from conventional systems and the new formulations are generated. This innovative sensing device will function based on the energy produced by the solar cells which will operate for a short period of time under the water where low parametric units are installed. In addition, the energy consumed for operating a particular unit is much lesser and this results in achieving high reliability using a probabilistic path finding algorithm. Further, two different application segments have been solved using the proposed formulations including the depth of monitoring the ocean. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, comparisons have been made with existing methods in terms of navigation output units, rate of decomposition for solar cells, reliability rate, and directivity where the proposed method proves to be more efficient for an average percentile of 64\%.},

	abstract = {Today, many people under the age of 10 are being examined for brain-related issues, including tumours, without displaying any symptoms. It is not unusual for children to develop brain-related concerns such as tumours and central nervous system disorders, which may affect 15\% of the population. Medical experts believe that the irregular eating habits (junk food) and the consumption of pesticide-tainted fruits and vegetables are to blame. The human body is naturally resistant to harmful gears, but only up to a point. If it exceeds the limit, a cell manipulation process is automatically initiated that can remove dangerous inactive tissues from the cell membrane and later grows into tumour blockage in the human body. Thus, the adoption of an advanced computer-based diagnostic system is highly recommended in order to generate visually enhanced images for anomaly identification and infectious tissue segmentation. In most cases, an MR image is chosen since it is easier to distinguish between affected and nonaffected tissue. Conventional convolution neural network (CCNN) mapping and feature extraction are difficult because of the vast volume of data. In addition, it takes a lengthy time for the MRI scanning process to obtain diverse positions for anomaly identification. Aside from the discomfort, the patient may experience motion abnormalities. Recurrent neural network (RNN) classifies tumour regions into several isolated portions much faster and more accurately, so that it can be prevented. To remove motion artefacts from dynamic multicontrast MR images, a novel long short-term memory- (LSTM-) based RNN framework is introduced in this research. With this method, the MR image’s visual quality is improved over CCNN while simultaneously mapping a larger volume and extracting more quiet characteristics than CCNN can. DC-CNN, SMSR-CNN, FMSI-CNN, and DRCA-CNN results are compared. For both low and high signal-to-noise ratios, the suggested LSTM-based RNN framework has gained reasonable feature intelligibility (SNRs). In comparison to previous approaches, it requires less computing and has higher accuracy when it comes to detecting infected portions.},

However, with the existing infrastructure, the system will not provide high-end support for the transfer of signals by using a communication medium, as biomedical signals need to be classified at appropriate stages. Therefore, this article addresses the issues of physical infrastructure, using Hadoop-based systems where a four-layer model is created. The four-layer model is integrated with Fuzzy Interface System Algorithm (FISA) with low robustness, and data transfers in these layers are carried out with reference health data that are collected at various treatment centers. The performance of this new flanged system model aims to minimize the loss functionalities that are present in biomedical signals, and an activation function is introduced at the middle stages. The effectiveness of the proposed model is simulated by using MATLAB, using a biomedical signal processing toolbox, where the performance of FISA proves to be better in terms of signal strength, distance, and cost. As a comparative outcome, the proposed method overlooks the conventional methods for an average percentage of 78\% in real-time conditions.},

	abstract = {Detecting intrusions from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems is one of the most essential and challenging processes in recent times. Most of the conventional works aim to develop an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) framework for increasing the security of SCADA against networking attacks. Nonetheless, it faces the problems of complexity in classification, requiring more time for training and testing, as well as increased misprediction results and error outputs. Hence, this research work intends to develop a novel IDS framework by implementing a combination of methodologies, such as clustering, optimization, and classification. The most popular and extensively utilized SCADA attacking datasets are taken for this system’s proposed IDS framework implementation and validation. The main contribution of this work is to accurately detect the intrusions from the given SCADA datasets with minimized computational operations and increased accuracy of classification. Additionally the proposed work aims to develop a simple and efficient classification technique for improving the security of SCADA systems. Initially, the dataset preprocessing and clustering processes were performed using the multifacet data clustering model (MDCM) in order to simplify the classification process. Then, the hybrid gradient descent spider monkey optimization (GDSMO) mechanism is implemented for selecting the optimal parameters from the clustered datasets, based on the global best solution. The main purpose of using the optimization methodology is to train the classifier with the optimized features to increase accuracy and reduce processing time. Moreover, the deep sequential long short term memory (DS-LSTM) is employed to identify the intrusions from the clustered datasets with efficient data model training. Finally, the proposed optimization-based classification methodology’s performance and results are validated and compared using various evaluation metrics.},

In addition, a novel system model for analyzing the behavior of biomedical signals has been developed, complete with an output tracking mechanism that delivers transceiver results in a low-power implementation approach. Because low-power transceivers are integrated, the cost of implementation for designated output units will be decreased. To prove the effectiveness of DCS feasibility, convergence and robustness characteristics are observed by incorporating an interface system that is processed with a deep learning toolbox. They compared test results using DCS to prove that all experimental scenarios prove to be much more effective for about 79 percent for variations with time periods.},

The information maintained in the web database is hidden and retrieves deep web content even in dynamic script pages. In recent days, a web page offers a huge amount of structured data and is in need of various web-related latest applications. The challenge lies in extracting complicated structured data from deep web pages. Deep web contents are generally accessed by the web queries, but extracting the structured data from the web database is a complex problem. Moreover, making use of such retrieved information in combined structures needs significant efforts. No further techniques are established to address the complexity in data extraction of deep web data from various web pages. Despite the fact that several ways for deep web data extraction are offered, very few research address template-related issues at the page level. For effective web data extraction with a large number of online pages, a unique representation of page generation using tree-based pattern matches (TBPM) is proposed. The performance of the proposed technique TBPM is compared to that of existing techniques in terms of relativity, precision, recall, and time consumption. The performance metrics such as high relativity is about 17-26\% are achieved when compared to FiVaTech approach.},

	abstract = {Providing security to the healthcare data stored in an IoT-cloud environment is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks in recent days. Because the IoT-cloud framework is constructed with an enormous number of sensors that are used to generate a massive amount of data, however, it is more susceptible to vulnerabilities and attacks, which degrades the security level of the network by performing malicious activities. Hence, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is the most suitable option for healthcare applications because it provides the best solution for improving the security and reliability of data. Due to this fact, various AI-based security mechanisms are implemented in the conventional works for the IoT-cloud framework. However, it faces significant problems of increased complexity in algorithm design, inefficient data handling, not being suitable for processing the unstructured data, increased cost of IoT sensors, and more time consumption. Therefore, this paper proposed an AI-based intelligent feature learning mechanism named Probabilistic Super Learning- (PSL-) Random Hashing (RH) for improving the security of healthcare data stored in IoT-cloud. Also, this paper is aimed at reducing the cost of IoT sensors by implementing the proposed learning model. Here, the training model has been maintained for detecting the attacks at the initial stage, where the properties of the reported attack are updated for learning the characteristics of attacks. In addition to that, the random key is generated based on the hash value of the data matrix, which is incorporated with the standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique for data security. Then, the enhanced ECC-RH mechanism performs the data encryption and decryption processes with the generated random hash key. During performance evaluation, the results of both existing and proposed techniques are validated and compared using different performance indicators.},

The main objective of this paper is to detect the most appropriate plant development parameters. This paper has the concept of reducing the hazards in agriculture and promoting intelligent farming. Advancement in agriculture is not new, but the AI-based wireless sensor will push intelligent agriculture to a new standard. The research goal of this work is to improve the prediction state using image processing-based machine learning techniques. The main objective of the paper, as described above, is to detect and control cotton leaf diseases. This paper comprises several aspects, including leaf disease detection, remote monitoring system depending on the server, moisture and temperature sensing, and soil sensing. Insects and pathogens are typically responsible for plant diseases that reduce productivity if not timely. This paper presents a method to monitor the soil quality and prevent cotton leaf diseases. The proposed system suggested uses a regression technique of artificial intelligence to identify and classify leaf diseases. The information would be delivered to farmers through the Android app after infection identification. The Android app also allows soil parameter values like moisture, humidity, and temperature to be displayed along with the chemical level in a container. The relay may be on/off to regulate the motor and chemical sprinkler system as required by using the Android app. In the proposed system, the SVM algorithm delivers the best accuracy in detecting various diseases and demonstrates its efficiency in the detection and control by the improvement of cultivation for the farmers.},

	abstract = {Due to air pollution, pollutants that harm humans and other species, as well as the environment and natural resources, can be detected in the atmosphere. In real-world applications, the following impurities that are caused due to smog, nicotine, bacteria, yeast, biogas, and carbon dioxide occur uninterruptedly and give rise to unavoidable pollutants. Weather, transportation, and the combustion of fossil fuels are all factors that contribute to air pollution. Uncontrolled fire in parts of grasslands and unmanaged construction projects are two factors that contribute to air pollution. The challenge of assessing contaminated air is critical. Machine learning algorithms are used to forecast the surroundings if any pollution level exceeds the corresponding limit. As a result, in the proposed method air pollution levels are predicted using a machine learning technique where a computer-aided procedure is employed in the process of developing technological aspects to estimate harmful element levels with 99.99\% accuracy. Some of the models used to enhance forecasts are Mean Square Error (MSE), Coefficient of Determination Error (CDE), and R Square Error (RSE).},

	abstract = {The majority of the current-generation individuals all around the world are dealing with a variety of health-related issues. The most common cause of health problems has been found as depression, which is caused by intellectual difficulties. However, most people are unable to recognize such occurrences in them, and no procedures for discriminating them from normal people have been created so far. Even some advanced technologies do not support distinct classes of individuals as language writing skills vary greatly across numerous places, making the central operations cumbersome. As a result, the primary goal of the proposed research is to create a unique model that can detect a variety of diseases in humans, thereby averting a high level of depression. A machine learning method known as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been included into this evolutionary process for extracting numerous features in three distinct units. The CNN also detects early-stage problems since it accepts input in the form of writing and sketching, both of which are turned to images. Furthermore, with this sort of image emotion analysis, ordinary reactions may be easily differentiated, resulting in more accurate prediction results. The characteristics such as reference line, tilt, length, edge, constraint, alignment, separation, and sectors are analyzed to test the usefulness of CNN for recognizing abnormalities, and the extracted features provide an enhanced value of around 74\%higher than the conventional models.},

A data fusion methodology, wherein more sensor data is merged to give relevant information, is necessary to transform the challenging process into a straightforward step-by-step operation. Ultrasonic sensors are used in stage 1 to identify any ambiguities in pipeline systems, and various sites are used to gauge the rate of leak detection. As a result, a novel model for estimating various types of gas leakage in pipeline systems is examined, put to the test, and contrasted. Five distinct scenarios are seen during the leakage testing procedure using data fusion, where the optimization is done using the fuzzy interface technique. This integration procedure detects leakage rates with high accuracy, and in every test instance, the best outcomes are obtained. Additionally, the predicted model can be used in real-time with a low failure rate of numerous sensors, with MATLAB being used to simulate the results.},

If such strong attacks are to create a reliable security system, attack detection is essential. Attacks and abnormalities such as user-to-root (U2R), denial-of-service, and data-type probing could have an impact on an IoT system.

	abstract = {Cloud services are a popular concept used to describe how internet-based services are delivered and maintained. The computer technology environment is being restructured with respect to information preservation. Data protection is of critical importance when storing huge volumes of information. In today’s cyber world, an intrusion is a significant security problem. Services, information, and services are all vulnerable to attack in the cloud due to its distributed structure of the cloud. Inappropriate behavior in the connection and in the host is detected using intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the cloud. DDoS attacks are difficult to protect against since they produce massive volumes of harmful information on the network. This assault forces the cloud services to become unavailable to target consumers, which depletes computer resources and leaves the provider exposed to massive financial and reputational losses. Cyber-analyst data mining techniques may assist in intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques are used to create many strategies. Attribute selection techniques are also vital in keeping the dataset’s dimensionality low. In this study, one method is provided, and the dataset is taken from the NSL-KDD dataset. In the first strategy, a filtering method called learning vector quantization (LVQ) is used, and in the second strategy, a dimensionality-simplifying method called PCA. The selected attributes from each technique are used for categorization before being tested against a DoS attack. This recent study shows that an LVQ-based SVM performs better than the competition in detecting threats.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is an environment where everything is provided as a service based on demand. It follows pay as per the used model in which the service consumer needs to pay for what they have consumed. Due to the increased dependence on digitalization, the number of consumers and providers tends to grow tremendously. The consumer who needs the service from the provider is not sure about the specified service outcome, and it is too hard for them to monitor and manage the service. Hence, a trusted third party called a trusted cloud broker (TCB) is introduced for managing the services. The service level agreements (SLA) management and reputation estimation framework is proposed, which includes three phases such as (i) SLA establishment between the three parties, (ii) violation detection by comparing the observed value of the TCB and (iii) the reputation and penalty estimation of the service. The novel TCB is created to monitor the deployed services, ensuring the achievement of SLA. The TCB observes the values and estimates the reputation value for each service. It is compared with the provider log-based reputation value and found that the proposed model provides a more precise reputation value for the service providers.},

As such technique is transmitted across a social network, broad adoption can occur. In the framework of suggestions and information dissemination on the blogosphere, we are considering cascades of information. Intrusion in a network environment poses a severe security risk. The intrusion detection system in the network is designed to detect attacks or malicious activity in a high-detection network while keeping a low false alarm rate. The system's behavior and flashing systems are monitoring important anomalies in the anomaly detection system (ADS). In this research, we present a method of identification of anomalies with “K-means + C4.5,” the method of cascading k-means clustering and the decision tree method C4.5, for classifying anomalous and typical computer network operations. K-Means is the first clustering method for separating training into K clusters with a similarity in Euclidean distance. In each cluster, we create decision structures with algorithms from the decision tree C4.5, indicating a density area of typical or abnormal cases. The Decision Tree illustrates the decision constraints for each cluster by learning the subgroups inside this cluster. We use the findings from the decision tree for each class to get a final conclusion. However, the K-means+C4.5 model is shown to be slightly superior to predict computer network anomalous activities with a rating of 99.2\% with true positive rate.},

The design process of implementation case is performed using an analytical framework by examining the primary energy sources at the initial state; thus, a smart network is supported. The designed mathematical model is integrated with a learning technique that allocates resources at proper quantities. Further, the complex manual tuning of individual appliances is avoided in the projected method as the input variables are driven in a direct way at reduced loss state. In addition, the data processing state of individual appliances is carried out using central data controller where all parametric values are stored. In case any errors are observed, then SCADA network fixes the error in an automated way, reducing end-to-end delays in all appliances. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five scenarios are examined and simulated where outcomes prove that SCADA network using learning models provides optimal results on an average of 84 percent as compared to the existing models without learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {The advancements in communication technologies and a rapid increase in the usage of IoT devices have resulted in an increased data generation rate. Storing, managing, and processing large quantities of unstructured data generated by IoT devices remain a huge challenge to cloud service providers (CSP). To reduce the storage overhead, CSPs implement deduplication algorithms on the cloud storage servers. It identifies and eliminates the redundant data blocks. However, implementing post-progress deduplication schemes does not address the bandwidth issues. Also, existing convergent key-based deduplication schemes are highly vulnerable to confirmation of file attacks (CFA) and can leak confidential information. To overcome these issues, FogDedupe, a fog-centric deduplication framework, is proposed. It performs source-level deduplication on the fog nodes to reduce the bandwidth usage and post-progress deduplication to improve the cloud storage efficiency. To perform source-level deduplication, a distributed index table is created and maintained in the fog nodes, and post-progress deduplication is performed using a multi-key homomorphic encryption technique. To evaluate the proposed FogDedupe framework, a testbed environment is created using the open-source Eucalyptus v.4.2.0 software and fog project v1.5.9 package. The proposed scheme tightens the security against CFA attacks and improves the storage overhead by 27\% and reduces the deduplication latency by 12\%.},

The platform of the cloud manages cloud software and legality issues in making contracts.

For these constraints, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) classifier and the SELECT Applicable Only to Parallel Server (SELECT-APSL ASA) method are proposed to separate the data related to the place. ASA is made up of the AODE and SELECT Applicable Only to Parallel Server. The AODE classifier is used to separate the data from smart city data based on the hybrid data obfuscation technique. The data from the hybrid data obfuscation technique manages 50\% of the raw data, and 50\% of hospital data is masked using the proposed transmission. The analysis of energy consumption before the cryptosystem shows the total packet delivered by about 71.66\% compared with existing algorithms. The analysis of energy consumption after cryptosystem assumption shows 47.34\% consumption, compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The average energy consumption before data obfuscation decreased by 2.47\%, and the average energy consumption after data obfuscation was reduced by 9.90\%. The analysis of the makespan time before data obfuscation decreased by 33.71\%. Compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, the study of makespan time after data obfuscation decreased by 1.3\%. These impressive results show the strength of our methodology.},

	abstract = {An encouraging development is the quick expansion of renewable energy extraction. Harnessing renewable energy is economically feasible at the current rate of technological advancement. Traditional energy sources, such as coal, petroleum, and hydrocarbons, which have negative effects on the environment, are coming under more social and financial pressure. Companies need more solar and wind power because this calls for a well-balanced mix of renewable resources and a higher proportion of alternative energy sources. Sustainable energy can be captured using a variety of techniques. Massive scale and small-sized are the two most prevalent techniques. No renewable energy source possesses an inherent property that restricts how it may be managed or how it can be planned to produce electricity. A number of factors have contributed to a growth in the use of alternative sources, one of which is to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures. To improve the ability to estimate renewable energy, various modeling approaches have been created. This region might use an HRES to give many sources with the inclusion of different energy sources. The inventiveness of solar and wind power and the brilliant ability of neural networks to handle complex time-series data signals have both aided in the prediction of sustainable energy. Therefore, this research will examine the numerous information models in order to determine which proposed models can provide accurate projections of renewable energy output, such as sunlight, wind, or pumped storage. In the fields of sustainable energy predictions, a number of machine learning methods, such as multilayer perceptions MLP, RNN CNN, and LSTM designs, are frequently utilized. This form of modeling uses historical data to predict potential values and can predict short-term patterns in solar and wind generation.},

In contrast, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques is expanding to deliver more valuable data at a cheaper cost. The hyperspectral images are created to operate in different locations using different band topologies, making the proposed model more practical and effective with the existing spectrum elements. Since flies movements are used to acquire hyperspectral images with straight-line perception, the proposed method also makes use of the bio-inspired Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA).

Many people find it difficult to communicate in emergency situations as a result of such communications. In this paper, a mobile cloud computing procedure is implemented in the suggested technique in order to prevent such circumstances, and to make the data transmission process more effective. An analytical framework that addresses five significant minimization and maximization objective functions is used to develop the projected model. Additionally, all mobile cloud computing nodes are designed with strong security, ensuring that all the resources are allocated appropriately. In order to isolate all the active functions, the analytical framework is coupled with a machine learning method known as Decision Tree. The suggested approach benefits society because all cloud nodes can extend their assistance in times of need at an affordable operating and maintenance cost. The efficacy of the proposed approach is tested in five scenarios, and the results of each scenario show that it is significantly more effective than current case studies on an average of 86\%.},

To handle such moving cases cloud platform is highly helpful as with respect to geographical location the goods are mapped in correct form. However incorporation of single cloud platform does not provide sufficient amount of storage about all goods thus a multiple cloud platform is introduced in proposed system. As multiple cloud platform is provided the security features of each data base system is also checked and enhanced using encryption keys. Moreover for proper operating conditions of multiple cloud platforms an analytical model is designed that synchronizes necessary data at end system. The defined analytical model focuses on solving multiple objectives that are related to critical energy problems where demand problems are reduced. Further the encryption process is carried out using Improved BlowFish Algorithm (IBFA) by allocating proper resources with decryption keys.

The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations.

Even though the majority of individuals are still protected, it is crucial to check for post-corona virus symptoms if someone is feeling a little lethargic. In order to identify the post-coronavirus symptoms and attacks that are present in the human body, the recommended approach is included. When a harmful virus spreads inside a human body, the post-diagnosis symptoms are considerably more dangerous, and if they are not recognised at an early stage, the risks will be increased. Additionally, if the post-symptoms are severe and go untreated, it might harm one’s mental health. In order to prevent someone from succumbing to depression, the technology of audio prediction is employed to recognise all the symptoms and potentially dangerous signs. Different choral characters are used to combine machine-learning algorithms to determine each person’s mental state. Design considerations are made for a separate device that detects audio attribute outputs in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested technique; compared to the previous method, the performance metric is substantially better by roughly 67\%.},

As a result, this paper investigates how mobile computing data are compressed under all transmission scenarios. The suggested approach integrates deep neural networks (DNN) at high weighting functionalities for compression modes. The proposed method employs appropriate data loading and precise compression ratios for successful data compression. The accuracy of multimedia data that must be conveyed to various users is higher even though compression ratios are higher. The same data are transferred at significantly higher compression ratios, which save time while also minimizing data mistakes that may occur at the receiver. The DNN process also includes a visible parameter for handling high data-weight situations. The visible parameter optimizes the data results, allowing simulation tools to readily observe the compressed data.

	abstract = {Smart grids are complex cyber-physical systems that incorporate smart devices’ communication capabilities into the grid to enable remote management and the control of power systems. However, this integration reveals numerous SCADA system flaws, which could compromise security goals and pose severe cyber threats to the smart grid. In conventional works, various attack detection methodologies are developed to strengthen the security of smart grid SCADA systems. However, they have several issues with complexity, slow training speed, time consumption, and inaccurate prediction outcomes. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel security framework for protecting smart grid SCADA systems against harmful network vulnerabilities or intrusions. Therefore, the proposed work is motivated to develop an intelligent meta-heuristic-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) mechanism for securing IoT-SCADA systems. The proposed framework includes the stages of dataset normalization, Zaire Ebola Search Optimization (ZESO), and Deep Random Kernel Forest Classification (DRKFC). First, the original benchmarking datasets are normalized based on content characterization and category transformation during preprocessing. After that, the ZESO algorithm is deployed to select the most relevant features for increasing the training speed and accuracy of attack detection. Moreover, the DRKFC technique accurately categorizes the normal and attacking data flows based on the optimized feature set. During the evaluation, the performance of the proposed ZESO-DRKFC method is validated and compared in terms of accuracy, detection rate, f1-score, and false acceptance rate. According to the results, it is observed that the ZESO-DRKFC mechanism outperforms other techniques with high accuracy (99\%) by precisely spotting intrusions in the smart grid systems.},

In this rapidly growing market, product and service reviews can influence our purchasing decisions. It is challenging to manually evaluate reviews to make decisions and examine business models. However, users can examine and automate this process with Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a well-known technique for evaluating and extracting information from written or audible texts. NLP research investigates the social architecture of societies. This article analyses the Amazon dataset using various combinations of voice components and deep learning. The suggested module focuses on identifying sentences as ‘Positive‘, ‘Neutral‘, ‘Negative‘, or ‘Indifferent‘. It analyses the data and labels the ‘better’ and ‘worse’ assumptions as positive and negative, respectively. With the expansion of the internet and e-commerce websites over the past decade, consumers now have a vast selection of products within the same domain, and NLP plays a vital part in classifying products based on evaluations. It is possible to predict sponsored and unpaid reviews using NLP with Machine Learning. This article examined various Machine Learning algorithms for predicting the sentiment of e-commerce website reviews.

Using anti-phishing technology requires experts to extract the characteristics of phishing URL sites and use behavioral principle which is identified through URL Behavioral Rectifier (U-BR). Then the feature dependability is supported to create URL probability phishing index (U-PFI) to identify the relative weight for detection of phishing sites. By attaining the feature weight, the features are observed using Optimized Multi Centric Feature Selection (OMCFS) issued to reduce the dimension Log variation, and then the selected features get trained through Conventional Neural Network (CNN). This method predicts the legitimacy of URLs without the access to web content to find the phishing and depends on domain related service.

Networking is becoming more sophisticated over time, and as the popularity of a successful technology grows, intrusion detection system security issues grow as well. There is a strong necessity for a solid defense in today’s cyber world. New attacks and malware pose a great challenge to the security community. Various machine learning techniques are being used in many intrusion detection systems to counter such attacks. Machine learning can learn on its own with minimal human interaction. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention to security concerns and associated machine learning defensive strategies, which inspires this paper’s complete survey. A thorough survey on diverse machine learning algorithms has been investigated in this paper to determine which algorithm is best suited for a specific attack; these techniques have been examined and compared in terms of their accuracy in detecting attacks.},

	abstract = {Providing security to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is one of the demanding and crucial tasks in recent days, due to the different types of attacks on the network. For this purpose, there are different types of attack detection and classification methodologies have been developed in the conventional works. But it limits with the issues like high complexity in design, misclassification results, increased error rate, and reduced detection efficiency. In order to solve these issues, this paper aims to develop an advanced machine learning models for improving the SCADA security. This work comprises the stages of preprocessing, clustering, feature selection, and classification. At first, the Markov Chain Clustering (MCC) model is implemented to cluster the network data by normalizing the feature values. Then, the Rapid Probabilistic Correlated Optimization (RPCO) mechanism is employed to select the optimal features by computing the matching score and likelihood of particles. Finally, the Block Correlated Neural Network (BCNN) technique is employed to classify the predicted label, where the relevancy score is computed by using the kernel function with the feature points. During experimentation, there are different performance indicators have been used to validate the results of proposed attack detection mechanisms. Also, the obtained results are compared with the RPCO-BCNN mechanism for proving the superiority of the proposed attack detection system.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection and classification have gained significant attention recently due to the increased utilization of networks. For this purpose, there are different types of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) approaches developed in the conventional works, which mainly focus on identifying the intrusions from the datasets with the help of classification techniques. Still, it is limited by the significant problems of inefficiency in handling large dimensional datasets, high computational complexity, false detection, and more time consumption for training the models. To solve these problems, this research intends to develop an innovative clustering-based classification methodology to precisely detect intrusions from the different types of IDS datasets. Here, the most recent and extensively used IDS datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS, and Bot-IoT have been employed for detecting intrusions. Data preprocessing has been performed to normalize the dataset to eliminate irrelevant attributes and organize the features. Then, the data separation is applied by forming the clusters by using an intelligent Anticipated Distance-based Clustering (ADC) incorporated with the Density-Based Spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBScan) algorithm. It helps to find the distance and density measures for grouping the attributes into the clusters, which increases the efficiency of classification. Here, the most suitable optimal parameters are selected using the Perpetual Pigeon Galvanized Optimization (PPGO) technique. The extracted features are used for training and testing the dataset samples. Consequently, the Likelihood Naïve Bayes (LNB) classification approach is implemented to accurately predict the classified label as to whether normal or attack. During the evaluation, the performance of the proposed IDS framework is validated and compared using various evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed ADC-DBScan-LNB model outperforms the other techniques with improved performance outcomes.},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer affects nearly 4\% of the women across the globe and leads to mortality if not treated in early stage. A few decades before, the mortality rate was too high when compared to the present statistics. This is achieved as nowadays most of women are aware of this disease and undergo health examination mainly for screening cervical cancer on regular basis. But only the accurate diagnosis can be helpful for further treatment. Many works are carried out for accurate diagnosis and always have some limitations in accurate predictions. In this work, an efficient algorithm is proposed for the accurate diagnosis of cervical cancer. A meta-heuristic called artificial Jellyfish search optimizer (JS) algorithm is combined with artificial neural network (ANN) to tackle this problem. The proposed algorithm is called JellyfishSearch\_ANN and is employed to classify the cervical cancer dataset with four type of targets based on the examination. The JellyfishSearch\_ANN provides outstanding results among other classifiers taken for comparison and mainly its classification accuracy is found to be above 98.87\% for all targets.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, integration of renewable energy source like solar, wind etc in the grid is encouraged to reduce the losses and meet the demand. However, the integration of these renewable sources, power electronic devices, non-linear and un-balanced loads leads to the power quality issues this motivated power researchers for the development of new controllers and techniques. This paper develops a soccer-league algorithm based optimal tuned hybrid controller for the unified power quality conditioner associated with the solar power and battery-storage systems with the Boost converter and Buck Boost converter. The UPQC simultaneously performs both the functions of Shunt active power filter and series active power filter. The proposed optimally designed controller adapts both the properties of fuzzy logic-controller and SOL algorithm tuned proportional-integral controllers. The Kp, Ki values of shunt and series controllers are treated as control variables, which are optimally tuned by SOL to satisfy the objective function. The key contributions of the proposed work are the reduction of total harmonics in current waveforms thereby enhancing the power factor, quick action to maintain the constant DC-Link capacitor voltage during the solar irradiation variations, elimination of voltage sag/swell/large disturbance, and appropriate compensation for the un-balanced networks and loads. The performance investigation of SLOHC was carried-out with four test studies for different combinations of unbalanced/balanced loads and supply voltage of 3-phase distribution network. Comparative analysis was carried out with those of standard methods like a genetic algorithm, biogeography-based optimization, and proportional-integral controllers. The proposed method reduces the total harmonic distortion to 2.06\%, 2.44\%, 2.40\%, and 2.32\% which are much lower than those of existing methods available in literature. The design has been performed on MATLAB/simulink software.},

	abstract = {With the advent of smart city networks and increased utilization of vehicles, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted more attention from researchers. But, providing security to this type of network is one of the challenging and demanding tasks in the present day. For this purpose, the conventional works developed many networking frameworks and methodologies to enhance the privacy and security of smart city systems. Still, it has the significant limitations of high complexity in algorithm design, requires more time consumption for processing, reduced maintenance, and does not require proper authentication verification. Therefore, the primary purpose of this work is to develop a new security model for smart city networks using a combination of methodologies. Here, the Collaborative Mutual Authentication (CMA) mechanism is used to validate the identity of users based on the private key, public key, session key, and generated hash function. In addition, the Meta-heuristic Genetic Algorithm – Random Forest (MGA-RF) technique is deployed to detect the attacks in the network, ensuring the security of the smart city. During an evaluation, the proposed authentication-based security mechanism’s performance is validated using various parameters, and the results are compared with the recent state-of-the-art models.},
